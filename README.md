# Personal Data Analytics Project: Improving Healthcare Efficiency and Patient Safety

## Introduction

In today's healthcare landscape, the effective management and analysis of patient data are crucial for ensuring both the efficiency of healthcare services and the safety of patients. In this project, we aim to utilize advanced data analytics techniques to identify potential cases of medication abuse, splitting claims, member abuse, and various other anomalies within healthcare claims data.

## Tools Used 
1. Python Pandas
2. Pyspark and spark SQL

## Problem Statement

Third Party Payers often face challenges in detecting patterns of abuse, inefficiencies, and potential risks within their systems. Without proper analysis, these issues can lead to financial losses, compromised patient care, and regulatory non-compliance. Hence, there is a critical need to develop data-driven approaches to mitigate these challenges.

## Business Requirements Document (BRD)

### Business Questions:

1. How frequently do we observe instances of medication abuse within our healthcare claims data?
2. Are there any patterns of splitting claims that indicate potential fraudulent activities?
3. What are the common characteristics of members engaging in abusive behaviors, such as repeated claims within a short period?
4. How often do we encounter claims from different areas or cities for the same member within a short timeframe?
5. Can we identify cases of chronic diseases among young members, and if so, what are the prevalent conditions?
6. Is there a pattern of charging consultation fees within short follow-up periods, and if yes, how does it impact our financial operations?
7. Are there instances of maternity services being claimed too soon after delivery, and if so, how can we address this issue?
8. How frequently do we observe dental and optical claims for infants, and are there any potential risks associated with these claims?
9. What patterns indicate potential dental abuse or excessive dental claims?
10. Are there any trends in claims submitted shortly before the policy end date, indicating potential attempts to maximize benefits?
11. Can we identify instances of unbundled services within our claims data, and if yes, how does it impact our billing practices?
12. Are there specific demographic groups, such as male members aged 18 to 60, who are more likely to submit work-related claims?
13. Are there patterns indicating potential infertility issues among female members, and if so, what are the common diagnostic procedures claimed?
14. How frequently do we observe claims related to herbal medication, and what are the associated risks?

## Solutions

To address the aforementioned business questions, we propose the following solutions:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Utilize Pandas for preprocessing and initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and prepare the healthcare claims data for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis with Spark SQL and PySpark**: Leverage Spark SQL and PySpark for advanced analysis of the preprocessed data, enabling scalable and efficient processing of large datasets.

## Business Impact

By implementing the proposed solutions, healthcare providers can achieve the following benefits:

- **Improved Detection of Fraud and Abuse**: Enhanced capability to identify and mitigate instances of medication abuse, splitting claims, member abuse, and other fraudulent activities within the healthcare system.

- **Cost Savings**: Reduction in financial losses associated with fraudulent claims, unnecessary procedures, and inefficiencies in healthcare service delivery.

- **Enhanced Patient Safety**: Identification of potential risks to patient safety, such as misdiagnosis, overutilization of services, and inappropriate treatments, leading to improved quality of care.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and standards by proactively addressing issues related to billing practices, patient care, and data privacy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the utilization of advanced data analytics techniques offers healthcare providers the opportunity to enhance efficiency, improve patient safety, and mitigate risks associated with fraudulent activities and abuse within the healthcare system. By leveraging the power of data, providers can make informed decisions to optimize resource allocation, streamline operations, and deliver high-quality care to patients.
